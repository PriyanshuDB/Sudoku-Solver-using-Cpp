# Sudoku-Solver-using-Cpp
This project is an implementation of a sudoku solver in C++. It is capable of solving expremely complex sudoku puzzles very quickly and also gurantees a 100 % correct solution (provided the solution exists).
An enhanced backtracking algorithm is used along with the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic to solve the puzzle in minimum time.
It is also equipped with a timer that displays the time taken for computation of the result.
An example sudoku puzzle (level : extreme , source : https://www.extremesudoku.info/) is hardcoded in the main function. You can run the code on a compiler and get the result.
The code has been tested for multiple lengthy puzzles, the time taken never exceeded 1 second.
